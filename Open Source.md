 - Theming
  - colors
  - fonts
  - show or hide elements
  - API for adjusting code
  - URLs for actions

## Global Functions - PHP
 - cast::configure(array $config);
  - Configure the casting library.

 - cast::{type}($value);
  - Cast the $value to the specific type.
  - integer() - strings to integers. Decimals round up or down by configuration.
  - string()
  - convert to string. Call __toString() on objects.
  - Blank strings to null. Configure option.

## Version Control System With Custom Paths
 - Version control system
 - Ability to add any file path or directory to your project
 - Even paths outside the project path
 - Allow only certain people to modify files.

## Error Reporting
 - Log errors with Monolog
 - Scan error logs for reports
 - Alert for errors: texts, emails, etc
 - Suggest possible solutions for errors
 - Match text of errors
 - Link to Stack Overflow

## Santa's Workshop
Content generator (files and directories) from templates. Creates **file content** as well.

## Data Manager Interface
 - Standard for wrapping data systems (ORMs, DBAL, etc).
 - Methods:
  - build(array $fields, $className = null)
  - export(BaseEntity $entity, $type = 'array')
   - json
   - xml
   - csv
   - file (Excel, CSV)
  - form($formName, $className = null)
  - isValid(BaseEntity $entity)
   - Return true/false for validation
  - getErrors()
   - Return array of errors for object.

## Global Framework Helper
 - Should I do this?
 - Call "TCB"? Example: TCB::cache('me'); That will get the cache with key 'me'.
 - Global helper to get basic Framework functionality.
  - input() - (Request, CLI arguments, etc)
  - output() (HTML, CSS, JS, files, images, JSON, text, etc)
  - dbal(string $sql) (call a database)
  - cache() - cache data between all users
  - session() - cache data for just this User
  - chain(mixed $var) - create Chain object with var quickly.
  - str(string $str) - create Stringy object
  - arr(array $arr) - Get Arr Collection object.
  - response(mixed $data) - Create response

## Execute Engine
 - Route to execute callbacks.
 - Useful for using 3rd party libraries and services.
 - Example:

```php

use Guzzle\Http\Client;

$client = new Client('http://www.example.com/api/v1/key/{key}', [
    'key' => '*** My Key Here ***'
]);

$request  = $client->get('users');
$response = $request->send();

return $response;

```

Now with Execute Engine:

```php

// Add this service in the Engine.
use Guzzle\Http\Client;

$engine->add('guzzle.api1.get', function (string $key, string $path) {

    $client = new Client('http://www.example.com/api/v1/key/{key}', [
        'key' => $key
    ]);

    $request  = $client->get($path);
    $response = $request->send();

    return $response;
});

// Now just call this:
$response = $engine->run('guzzle.api1.get', [
    'key'  => $key,
    'path' => 'users',
]);

```

So now Guzzle could require the Engine (they don't right now) and configure an Engine to be used... all the end users
would have to do is see what the services are in the Engine.

- No documentation to read.
- No code to write.
- Just use the ```php$engine```.
