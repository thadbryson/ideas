# Ideas of Thad Bryson

I've written some ideas. Ones for open source projects, websites, PSRs, and more. They're in separate .md files. You
can view them in this repository. 

Feel free to implement them yourself if you'd like. They don't have to open sourced. You can make money from them 
if you'd like. 

You can find them in the **docs/** folder of this project.
