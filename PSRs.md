# PSRs

Frameworks are tools that help you build things. I have some ideas for patterns that usually show up in frameworks.

## Goals
 - SOA (service oriented architecture - is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology.
 - Replaceable parts

## Standards for the the following:
 - Services - Parts of a framework
 - Connections between these parts
 - Configurations - How to build these parts
 - Input - data that gets passed into the system
 - Output - structure of data that gets returned or outputted by the system

## Communication
 - HTTP
 - FTP
 - SSH
 - Command line input
 - Software arrays

## Services
 - Dependency Injection Container
 - Routing
 - Controllers with actions
 - Chains of events

## Events
 - Immediate calls
 - Delayed calls
 - Scheduled calls

## Views
 - Input
 - HTTP
 - FTP
 - Web Sockets

## Output
 - HTML
 - File creation
 - HTTP Responses
 - Database inserts, updates, deletes
 - Emails

## Data Manager
 - see "Open Source.md"

## Trait Boot Methods
 - Methods that get loaded when object constructor is called.
 - Name begins with "boot".
